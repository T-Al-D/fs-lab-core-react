# fs-lab-core-react

Core React frontend of the fs-lab fullstack architecture.

**Live Demo:** https://fs-lab-core-react.onrender.com/

## Purpose

This project serves as a reference React + TypeScript frontend for experimenting
with frontend architecture, client-side routing, API integration, and deployment via Render.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed via Render (Static Site) on every push to `main`,
including client-side routing with SPA fallback configuration.

## Status

Active development. Used as a sandbox for frontend architecture, routing, and API integration experiments.

## Runtime Notes

The backend API is deployed on Render's free tier and may enter sleep mode during inactivity.
As a result, the first API request after a period of inactivity can experience a short delay.
